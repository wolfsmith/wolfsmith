# 👋 Hi, I'm an Independent Developer

I create small but powerful web tools that make everyday tasks faster, easier, and more reliable.  
Instead of bloated apps or complicated setups, I focus on **lightweight solutions** that just work – right in your browser.

### 📝 [Markdown → Word Converter](https://www.markdown-to-word.online/)

Markdown is perfect for writing — clean, fast, and distraction-free.
But sharing those documents with others often means one thing: **Word files**.

This tool was built for that exact gap. It lets you convert Markdown into a properly structured `.docx` file **without installing anything**, configuring Pandoc, or dealing with editor plugins.

- **Paste & Convert:** Paste Markdown directly and download a ready-to-share Word document.
- **Structure Preserved:** Headings, lists, tables, code blocks, and basic formatting stay intact.
- **Zero Setup:** No accounts, no uploads, no local dependencies.
- **Fast & Lightweight:** Conversion happens instantly in the browser.
- **Practical by Design:** Ideal for sharing docs with teammates, clients, or anyone not using Markdown.

It’s not meant to replace powerful tools like Pandoc —
it’s a **simple, reliable fallback** when you just need a clean Word file, quickly.
